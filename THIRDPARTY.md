# 3rd Party
Roboquant couldn't have been developed without the use of free and open source software. This documents
list some of these great libraries.


# Software
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org): modern, concise and safe programming language that makes writing code a joy
* [TA-Lib](https://ta-lib.org): an extensive library of technical indicators
* Several [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/) libraries:
  * [Echarts](https://echarts.apache.org) an open source JavaScript visualization library with stunning charts
  * [Avro](https://avro.apache.org) data serialization system for fast and efficient storage of large amounts of data
  * [Commons Math](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/) a library of lightweight, self-contained mathematics
  and statistics components
* [Jupyter](https://www.jupyter.org): the standard for interactive development and perhaps best known in combination 
  with Python and R. But it also works like a charm with a Kotlin kernel.
* [FastCSV](https://github.com/osiegmar/FastCSV): an ulta-fast and easy to use CSV parser
