    "- In a Jupyter Notebook \n",
    "- As a standalone library in your IDE of choice\n",
    "\n",
    "Both share exactly the same code-base, so there is no difference how your strategies behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Notebook approach is a great to quickly be up and running and have a more iterative approach to developing new trading strategies. It comes also with some charts that visualize how your strategy is poerformning.\n",
    "\n",
    "And as your strategy grows, you might benefit from the power of a full-fledged IDE like IDEA.\n",
