    "# Introduction\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the integration capabilities of roboquant with Alpaca. Alpaca is a new broker with an \"API-first\" approach, so a great fit for algoritmic trading. Besides being a broker that offers US stocks & crypto assets for trading, they also provide a nice data api. Under the hood roboquant uses the excellent [alpaca-java](https://petersoj.github.io/alpaca-java/) library by jacob Peterson to do much of the heavy lifting.    \n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently three types of integration available:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the historic data from Alpaca\n",
    "2. Use live data from Alpaca\n",
    "3. Use the Alpaca trading functionality (WIP)\n",
    "\n",
    "Alpaca has different subscriptions which offer different functionality. But this notebook should run fine with the free-tier and just the default paper-trading account.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll run a very simple strategy since the focus is Alpaca integration for this notebook. But there are other notebooks available that focus on how to develop custom strategies and other aspect of roboquant like charting. "

Please note we create a very fast EMA (Exponential Moving Average) Crossover. Not a very common practice, but for the purpose of this demo we don't want to have to wait too long before any results can be observed.  "
