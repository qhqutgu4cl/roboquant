# Module roboquant-jupyter

The roboquant-jupyter module contains the additional functionality to use roboquant within a Kotlin Jupyter Notebook. The main added feature is an extensice charting solution.

The use of this module is optional, but if you are working in a Jupyter Notebook, it is highly recommended.

# Package org.roboquant.jupyter
