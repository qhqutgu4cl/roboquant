= TA-Lib wrapper

This directory contains the code used to generate a wrapper for TA-Lib. It generates Kotlin code based on a JSON definition file that is also included in this directory.

== Run
To run the script and replace the current source with the new one, you can run the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
kotlinc -script script/TaLibGenerator.main.kts
mv TaLib.kt ../../roboquant-ta/src/main/kotlin/org/roboquant/ta/TaLib.kt
----

== Background
TA-Lib is a great library for technical analysis. It comes with 200 indicators out of the box, ranging from moving averages to detecting all kinds of candlestick patterns. It is available in many languages and used by many traders.

The native Java version of the TA-Lib library is high performant, but can be challenging to use.
So roboquant provides this wrapper to make it convenient to include these indicators in your own trading strategies.
