= 3rd Party

_Roboquant_ couldn't have been developed without the use of free and open source third party software. This document list some of the great open software libraries and other artefacts used in roboquant.

== Software
* https://kotlinlang.org[Kotlin]: modern, concise and safe programming language that makes writing code a joy.
* https://ta-lib.org[TA-Lib]: an extensive library of technical indicators.
* https://github.com/ta4j/ta4j[ta4j]: another great library for technical analysis.
* https://github.com/ECharts-Java/ECharts-Java[ECharts-Java]: a Java library that makes it very easy to create https://echarts.apache.org[ECharts] visualizations.
* https://avro.apache.org[Avro]: data serialization system for fast and efficient storage of large amounts of data.
* https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/[Commons Math]: a library of lightweight, self-contained mathematics and statistics components.
* https://www.jupyter.org[Jupyter]: the standard for interactive development and perhaps best known in combination with Python and R. But it also works like a charm with a Kotlin kernel.
* https://github.com/osiegmar/FastCSV[FastCSV]: an ultra-fast and easy to use CSV parser.

== Other artefacts
* `Comfortaa` font created by Johan Aakerlund. I really like how _roboquant_ looks like using `Comfortaa` font.
* Modified robot image from Free Vector Characters, as also seen on the README page and https://roboquant.org[roboquant.org] website.
