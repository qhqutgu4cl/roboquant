= 3rd Party

Roboquant couldn't have been developed without the use of free and open source third party software. This document
list some great open source libraries and other artefacts used in roboquant.

== Software

* https://kotlinlang.org[Kotlin]: modern, concise and safe programming language that makes writing code a joy.
* https://ta-lib.org[TA-Lib]: an extensive library of technical indicators.
* Several https://www.apache.org/[Apache Software Foundation] libraries:
* https://echarts.apache.org[Echarts] an open source JavaScript visualization library with stunning charts.
* https://avro.apache.org[Avro] data serialization system for fast and efficient storage of large amounts of data.
* https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/[Commons Math] a library of lightweight, self-contained mathematics
 and statistics components.
* https://www.jupyter.org[Jupyter]: the standard for interactive development and perhaps best known in combination
 with Python and R. But it also works like a charm with a Kotlin kernel.
* https://github.com/osiegmar/FastCSV[FastCSV]: an ultra-fast and easy to use CSV parser.

== Other artefacts

* Comfortaa font created by Johan Aakerlund, I love how _roboquant_ looks like using Comfortaa font.
* Robot image from Free Vector Characters, as also seen on the README page and https://roboquant.org[roboquant.org] website.
