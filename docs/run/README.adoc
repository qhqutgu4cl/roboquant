= Purpose

This directory contains IntelliJ IDEA configuration files for running roboquant for special use-cases.

== With Coverage
Run extended unit tests to improve code coverage. By default these extra unit tests are not enabled since they take too much extra time.
The overall goal is to maintain a roboquant test coverage > 90%.

== Performance with Flight recorder
Runs a mixed performance test with flight recorder enabled. The resulting `roboquant_recording.jfr` file can be opened with a tool like VisualVM and further inspection.
