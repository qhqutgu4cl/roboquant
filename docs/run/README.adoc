= Purpose

This directory contains various IntelliJ IDEA configuration files for testing _roboquant_.

== With Coverage
Run extended unit tests to improve code coverage. By default, these extra unit tests are not enabled since they take too much extra time.
The overall goal is to maintain a roboquant test coverage > 90%.

== Performance with Flight recorder
Run a mixed performance test with flight recorder enabled. The resulting `roboquant_recording.jfr` file can be opened with a tool like VisualVM and further inspection.

== Detekt
detekt.yaml contains the Detekt rules that are being used to validate the code against.
