== Code sample
To demonstrate how easy it is to get started, the following code snippet shows all the key ingredients required to back-test a trading strategy:

[source,kotlin]
----
val strategy = EMACrossover() // <1>
val metric = AccountSummary() // <2>
val roboquant = Roboquant(strategy, metric) // <3>

val feed = CSVFeed("data/US") // <4>
roboquant.run(feed) // <5>
----
<1> Create the strategy that you want to validate
<2> Define the metrics you want to use during the test
<3> Create a Roboquant instance, the engine of the framework
<4> What data should be used, in this case CSV files
<5> Run the back test

== Installation
=== Library
Just add `roboquant` or any of the other modules as a dependency to your build tool, like Maven or Gradle. See also link:/docs/INSTALL.adoc[installation guide] for more ways to install and use roboquant.

*Maven*
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.roboquant</groupId>
    <artifactId>roboquant</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
----

*Gradle*
[source,groovy]
----
implementation group: 'org.roboquant', name: 'roboquant', version: 'VERSION'
----

=== Jupyter Notebooks
If you have already Docker installed, all it takes is a single command to have a fully functional Jupyter Lab environment available:

[source,shell]
----
docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 roboquant/jupyter 
----

This also comes with several tutorials. And if you just want to try it without any installation, go toimage:https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg[Binder,link=https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neurallayer/roboquant-notebook/main?urlpath=lab/tree/tutorials], although it might be a bit slow to start the environment.
