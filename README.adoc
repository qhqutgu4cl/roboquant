== Code sample
To demonstrate how easy it is to get started, the following code snippet shows all the key ingredients required to back-test a trading strategy:

[source,kotlin]
----
val strategy = EMACrossover() // <1>
val metric = AccountSummary() // <2>
val roboquant = Roboquant(strategy, metric) // <3>

val feed = CSVFeed("data/US") // <4>
roboquant.run(feed) // <5>
----
<1> Create the strategy that you want to validate
<2> Define the metrics you want to monitor during the test
<3> Create a Roboquant instance, the engine of the platform
<4> What data should be used, in this case CSV files
<5> Run the back test
