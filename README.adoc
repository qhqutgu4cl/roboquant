_Roboquant_ is an algorithmic trading platform that is lightning fast and flexible while at the same time strives to be developer friendly. It is fully open source, written in Kotlin, and can be used in Jupyter Notebooks as well as standalone applications.

It is designed to be used by anyone serious about algo trading, from beginning retail traders to established trading firms. You can find out more at *https://roboquant.org[roboquant.org]*.

Please consider giving this repository a star ‚≠ê if you like the project.

== Code sample
To demonstrate how easy it is to get started, the following code snippet shows all the ingredients required to back-test a trading strategy:

[source,kotlin]
----
val strategy = EMACrossover() // <1>
val feed = CSVFeed("data/US") // <2>
val account = run(feed, strategy) // <3>
println(account) // <4>
----
<1> Create the strategy that you want to validate
<2> What data should be used, in this case, CSV files
<3> Run the back test
<4> Print the account at the end of the run

You can find out more at the online https://roboquant.org/tutorial/index.html[tutorial^].

== Installation

=== Library
You can develop our own trading application in your favourite IDE using _roboquant_ as a library.

image:/docs/idea_screenshot.png[IntelliJ IDEA]

Just add roboquant and optional any of the additional modules as a dependency to your build tool, like Maven or Gradle.

==== Maven
Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.roboquant</groupId>
    <artifactId>roboquant</artifactId>
    <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
----

Or if you want to create your own new algo-trading project from scratch, you can run the Maven Archetype:

[source,shell]
----
mvn archetype:generate                          \
-DarchetypeGroupId=org.roboquant                \
-DarchetypeArtifactId=roboquant-quickstart      \
-DarchetypeVersion=2.0.0                        \
-DgroupId=org.mydomain                          \
-DartifactId=myapp                              \
-Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

==== Gradle
Add the following line to your gradle script:
[source,groovy]
----
implementation group: 'org.roboquant', name: 'roboquant', version: 'VERSION'
----

See also link:/docs/INSTALL.adoc[installation guide] for more ways to install and use _roboquant_.

If you just want to try it out without any installation, go to image:https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg[Binder,link=https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neurallayer/roboquant-notebook/main?urlpath=lab/tree/notebooks/,window=_blank]

If you already have Docker installed, all it takes is a single command to have a fully functional Jupyter Notebook environment available on your local machine. This image also comes with several example notebooks included.

[source,shell]
----
docker run -p 8888:8888 roboquant/jupyter
