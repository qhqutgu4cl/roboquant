_Roboquant_ is an algorithmic trading platform that is very fast and flexible while at the same time strives to be easy to use. It is fully open source, written in Kotlin, and can be used in Jupyter Notebooks as well as standalone applications.

It is designed to be used by anyone serious about algo trading, from beginning retail traders to established trading firms. You can find out more at *https://roboquant.org[roboquant.org]*. Please consider giving this repository a star ‚≠ê if you like the project.

== Code sample
To demonstrate how easy it is to get started, the following code snippet shows the key ingredients required to back-test a trading strategy:

[source,kotlin]
----
val strategy = EMAStrategy() // <1>
val metric = AccountMetric() // <2>
val roboquant = Roboquant(strategy, metric) // <3>

val feed = CSVFeed("data/US") // <4>
roboquant.run(feed) // <5>
----
<1> Create the strategy that you want to validate
<2> Define the metrics you want to monitor during the back-test
<3> Create a Roboquant instance, the engine of the platform
<4> What data should be used, in this case CSV files
<5> Run the back test

You can find out more at the online https://roboquant.org/tutorial/index.html[tutorial^].
