 * Signal provides a rating for an [Asset] and is typically created by a strategy.
 *
 * It depends on the signalConverter how these signals are translated into actual orders, but possible scenarios are:
 *
 *  - A BUY rating results in going long for that asset. A SELL rating results in going short
 *  - The target price will become an additional take profit order
 *  - The probability determines the stake (volume) of the order. The more confident, the larger the stake
 *
 * @property asset The asset for which this rating applies
 * @property rating The rating for the asset
 * @property type The type of signal, entry, exit or both. [SignalType.BOTH] is the default.
 * @property tag Optional extra tag, for example, the strategy name that generated the signal, default is empty String
 * @constructor Create a new Signal
